# Meet Mute Toggle

You're in a Google Meet. Maybe you're passively paying attention while getting some work done or catching up on the news. Suddenly, you hear your name and a question directed at you. The meeting grinds to a halt while you struggle to find the tab in the sea of 50 you have open. Finally, you find it only to start with, "sorry I was muted." 

Yea. We know. 

This extension will put a mute toggle right at the top of your browser and allow you to mute/unmute without finding the meeting tab. It will also show your mute status to ensure you never have a hot mic when you don't intend to. Bind a hotkey to it if you're feeling fancy. 

Save your colleagues from 10 seconds of uncomfortable silence and enjoy. 

## Usage

Once you enter a Google Meet, the toolbar icon will light up displaying your mute status.
